# Whistle AI: Your Smart Log Monitor for Your Homelab, Powered by Local LLMs

We've all been there: digging through endless log files, trying to spot the one critical error message buried in a sea of routine system noise. Traditional log monitoring tools help, but they often rely on rigid rules and keyword matching, leading to either missed alerts or a flood of false positives.

What if you could have a smarter, more intuitive watchdog for your systems?

Introducing **Whistle AI**, a lightweight, intelligent log monitoring tool designed for homelab enthusiasts and server administrators. And the best part? You can run it with your own private, local Large Language Model (LLM) using HoML.

## What is Whistle AI?

Whistle AI isn't just another log parser. It leverages the power of AI to understand the *context* of your log messages. Instead of just matching keywords, it analyzes logs in real-time to distinguish between harmless informational messages and genuine, critical events that need your attention.

Here’s what makes Whistle AI stand out:

*   **Ease of Deployment:** It’s a single binary that can be installed on any Linux system with one command.
*   **AI-Powered Filtering:** By using an LLM, it can identify anomalies and errors with greater accuracy, reducing alert fatigue.
*   **Flexible Configuration:** You can easily tell it which logs to watch, from kernel messages to specific `systemd` services.
*   **Extensible Notifications:** Get alerts on Slack, email, or through a custom webhook.

## The Power of Local LLMs: Privacy, Performance, and No Bills

While you can connect Whistle AI to cloud-based AI services, the real magic happens when you pair it with a local LLM server like the one you can set up with **HoML**.

Running your own LLM for log analysis offers huge advantages:

*   **Total Privacy:** Your system logs contain sensitive information. By using HoML, you keep all that data on your own machine. Nothing ever leaves your network.
*   **Zero API Costs:** Forget about paying for API calls. Run as many analyses as you want, 24/7, at no extra cost.
*   **Unleashed Performance:** With HoML, you can use high-performance models that analyze logs at incredible speeds, right on your own hardware.

Configuring Whistle AI to use your local HoML server is as simple as running one command:

```bash
whistle config llm --base_url http://localhost:8000/v1 --model my-local-model --api_key dummy-key
```

## Get Started in Minutes

Ready to give it a try? Here’s how quickly you can set up your AI-powered log monitor:

1.  **Install Whistle AI:**
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wsmlby/whistle/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
    ```

2.  **Configure Your LLM and Alerts:**
    ```bash
    # Point it to your local HoML server
    whistle config llm --base_url http://localhost:8000/v1 --model my-local-model --api_key not-needed

    # Set up Slack notifications
    whistle config alert --slack https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ
    ```

3.  **Install and Start the Service:**
    ```bash
    # This sets up the systemd service
    whistle service install

    # Start monitoring!
    sudo service whistle-ai start
    ```

You can even use Whistle to perform a one-time analysis of past logs to find issues you might have missed:
`whistle analyze --since "1 hour ago"`

## A Perfect Match for Your Homelab

Whistle AI is a perfect example of the powerful, practical applications you can build and run in your own homelab with local LLMs. It’s a tool that solves a real-world problem while giving you complete control over your data and infrastructure.

Give it a try and see how a little bit of AI can make managing your systems a whole lot easier.
